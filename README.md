Hello World!
============

The idea of this project is to explore and learn how prolog can be used to process chess games.

The intent is not to implement a chess engine, but rather to create utilities to e.g
parse FEN-strings, PGN-moves, to verify move correctness, to generate a list of legal moves
etc.

If all goes well maybe we can even create a small frontend to test out the utilities eventually.
