# Notes for me

## TODOs for GUI Development

- Pre-render bitmaps in various sizes. Force chessboard to be 8 x those sizes

- Define a board class that knows all the squares and that can "load" a position

- Define a game-frame that can follow a game.

- Allow board to input new moves, both using keyboard AND mouse

- Display FEN info somewhere, e.g move nr, whose turn, CHECK, etc

- Parse UCI engine output. Add a frame for that
