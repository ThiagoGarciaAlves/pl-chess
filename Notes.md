# Notes for me

## TODOs for GUI Development

- Read up on how to define classes using XPCE
- Define a square class that has options to enable displaying a chess piece, a "name" and highlights of different colors.

- Define a board class that knows all the squares and that can "load" a position
- Define a game-frame that can follow a game.

- Allow board to input new moves, both using keyboard AND mouse

- Display FEN info somewhere, e.g move nr, whose turn, CHECK, etc

- Parse UCI engine output. Add a frame for that
