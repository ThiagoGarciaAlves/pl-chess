# Notes for me

## TODOs for GUI Development

- Figure out protocol for GUI -> Logic communication

- Display FEN info somewhere, e.g move nr, whose turn, CHECK, etc

- Define a game-frame that can follow a game.

- Allow board to input new moves, both using keyboard AND mouse

- Parse UCI engine output. Add a frame for that
