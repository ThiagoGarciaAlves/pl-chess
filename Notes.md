# Notes for me

## TODOs for Engine Analysis


### Debugging/Flexibility

Amend the 'Engine State'-structure with meta-data.

- A log of the N latest engine lines would be useful



### "Go"

- Add a command for telling the engine to analyse

- Parse engine info-strings during analysis.



### Options

Add options management.

- Allow echoing options back to a client (in a Prology way)

- Support changing option values


## TODOs for GUI Development

- Figure out protocol for GUI -> Logic communication

- Display FEN info somewhere, e.g move nr, whose turn, CHECK, etc

- Define a game-frame that can follow a game.

- Allow board to input new moves, both using keyboard AND mouse

- Parse UCI engine output. Add a frame for that
